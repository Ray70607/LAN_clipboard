# LAN_clipboard
a python script used to send text data across LAN, inspired by Apple's Universal Clipboard



this thing requires python flask  https://flask.palletsprojects.com

future plans:
make posting and getting automatic</br>
support file transfer </br>
support for clipboard history</br>
compiling into exe and apk</br>
maybe get rid of the web page and integrate it into the system
