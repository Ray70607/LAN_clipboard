# LAN_clipboard
a python script used to send text data across LAN, inspired by Apple's Universal Clipboard



this thing requires python flask  https://flask.palletsprojects.com
```bash
pip3 install Flask
```
</br>
important note: Flask might require administrative privilages to execute!
</br></br>
now runing on a host machine on a webpage, connect to the LAN ip of the host on port 5000 to access the webpage, the page is self-explanatory 

</br></br>


future plans:</br>
make posting and getting automatic</br>
support file transfer </br>
support for clipboard history</br>
compiling into exe and apk</br>
maybe get rid of the web page and integrate it into the system
